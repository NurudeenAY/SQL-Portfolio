# COVID-19 Data Exploration using SQL

This project explores global COVID-19 data using SQL. The goal is to analyze and visualize the data to gain insights into the pandemic's impact on different countries.

## Data Source
The data used in this project is obtained from Our World in Data. The dataset contains daily COVID-19 statistics, including confirmed cases, deaths, and vaccinations, for different countries.

## Technologies Used

SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)

T-SQL

Microsoft Excel

## Usage
Install SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) on your machine.
Open SSMS and connect to a local or remote SQL Server instance.
Open covid_data.sql in SSMS and execute the queries.
The output of the queries can be copied to Excel or any other tool for further analysis and visualization.
Open covid_data.xlsx to view visualizations of the data.

## SQL Queries

The COVID Portfolio.sql file contains several SQL queries used to explore the COVID-19 data. The queries cover the following topics:

Data Cleaning: cleaning and transforming the raw data to make it more usable

Global Trends: analyzing the global trends in COVID-19 cases, deaths, and vaccinations

Country Comparisons: comparing the COVID-19 statistics of different countries

Vaccination Analysis: analyzing the vaccination data and its impact on COVID-19 cases and deaths

## Conclusion

This project provides a starting point for exploring global COVID-19 data using SQL. The data can be further analyzed and visualized to gain insights into the pandemic's impact on different countries and regions.
